Overview Ideas
- High School Graduation Goal: ID how computer science, Android sideloading, Computer Apps, etc. can lead to part time jobs and earing income
  - Campus EPSB, Gaming Competitions (see Mr. Mercer for venues), Careers the Next Generation, Work Experience, Summer Internships, etc.
- End Goal of Drawing Program & Music Program, sideloaded to Android or running as a Computer App
  - No need for permissions or other personal information shared
- [Case Study, Brain Storming] Creating the Ultimate Drawing (Notation) Program used for presentations, etc.
  - Note: advanced prototyping is Server-Client running on same computer (ignoring Stack, Sockets, and VPN Tunneling)
- [Case Study, Brain Storming] Creating the Ultimate Music Program used in Drawing Program or stand-alone
  - Example: music fan, mediation or other unique tastes, instrumentation (i.e. saxophone favorites)
  - Example: "demo" examples or music can be emailed as an executable app (developing this can be viewed as a part-time job)
- Question: personal reason for developing Drawing and Music Programs
- [Longer Activity] Paper and Pencil Case Studies
  - Note: creativity is mandatory
  - Products that look like mine, student exemplars, or classmates will be graded less
  - Must use other peoples ideas and change them
    - Note: hierarchy of changes exits (easier changes to original ideas)
    - Image or word descriptions here are acceptable
  - Note: computer science can be applied to all creative ideas - it is the creative idea and the application of CS I am evaluating
- Create Hosted GitHub Repositories for both projects
- Prepare Computer Environments
- Intro HTML & CSS in ReadMe.md Files & GitHub Markdown
  - Research: URL, date accessed, and notes
  - To Do List (related to daily lessons & course plan, class-time work or synchronous, and a-synchronous work times)
  - Original Case Study Image and additional images
  - Progress Notes (related to rubrics and grading)
- Websites: HTML & inline CSS Promotional Website
  - Main Promotion completed when actual programs completed (including screenshots & finalized highlights list)
    - Application of Splash Page to 3-column flexbox
    - Video or screenshot description of use and function
      (AP Style presentation, similar to walking around student desks asking "show me what you have so far" & answering " what does that do?")
  - About Author (modified Who Am I)
  - Site Map and Links (inside and outside webpage, note date accessed)
  - App Version Downloads (executable or Processing-Java version)
    - Note: Processing-Java may not run on another program as developed on author's
  - Next Project (Project Credit): full program, start to finish, mimics all steps
    - Case Study: main screenshot, general GUI, features list, behaviors
    - Final Product and Prototyping illustrating development progress (similar to lessons demonstrating potential and then actual product)
    - To Do List for future versions

Websites Idea list:
- Demonstration of Gr5 Website
- Notes and explanations
- Demonstrating how Webhosting, Building, Maintenance, & Viewing Looks like (Question with Google Drawing Response or Image)
- Creating a Website to learn Websites
- Include JavaScript Off Code
- Reading URLs
- Computer Environment and Building GitHub Hosted Website
- What does it mean to host locally or access server? How do you know which one you are doing?


Static Prototyping - Rectangle



Introduction to Processing-IDE and Variables
- Drawing a Rectangle (Continuation from Websites, DIVs): floats and doubles with size
- Note: ratios only to know about space (continuing from Websites, pixel counting is not useful when displays change)
- Quick Assignment: drawing other shapes
- Sequential Coding Assignment: developing visual data of 2D Shapes (review of Processing.org / Reference)
- Full Assignment: drawing rect() with (note: all single lines of code)
  1. Text using Strings
  2. Images using PImage Variables
  3. Imbedded 2D Shapes within rect()
- Note: will develop sequential algorithms for text, images (aspect ratio), and imbedded shapes

Introduction to Single-line-IFs and other Decisions: Display Geometry
- size() vs. fullScreen()
- Display Dimensions
- Display Orientation
- [Algorithm] Will size work on the current display?
- [Algorithm] Is display the same orientation as what developer coded for?
- [Advanced] Can code save user from not knowing about display orientations (i.e. "Bruh, turn your phun")
- [Advanced]: media queries (similar to Websites)

Measles Assignment (or Celebration Cards, etc.)
- Top Grades for Advanced Measles or Celebration Cards

Tools to develop
- sequential code for visual data
- how to count
- primitive data
- Booleans to communicate between procedures
- subprograms (VOIDs) for specific uses
- [OPTIONAL] Text Auto-calculator

The new calculator application exploring BEDMAS, ratios, and various display orientations
See Malici's scalable display
- Assignments

Assignment Operators
How to count - Chess Board Type Nested FOR Loops
- index variables, notation to summarize in chart form
- able to copy and paste formulae

Display Geometry Checking
- Logical Operators
- Ternary Operator

3x3 Assignment
- Develop a story for buttons
- Required
- 11 buttons: preplanned and non-overlapping
- 9 examples of visual data: either images, text, 2d shapes, or mix
- Splash Screen: beginning section of button, text, and image
- Ending & Restarting Section
- 1 Section that could be QUIT and RESTART Buttons only

# How we learn

Coding the Hard Way: typing out every line, sometimes using copy and paste
- Caution: Processing-JAVA will break if copy and paste is used too much (copy into Notepad to delete hidden formatting characters or retype the entire doc)
- See https://github.com/QEHS-ProcessingJava/Common-Syntax-Error-and-Solution
- Mr. Mercer will demonstrate his method for typing code

Evaluation: bugs and talking about code provides Mr. Mercer anecdotal evidence of your learning

Assessment: multiple types
- submitting coded apps so Mr. Mercer can experience the user experience and read some code
- submitting narrated videos (max 60 seconds) of code highlighting coding structures Mr. Mercer is asking for while explaining what they do (arithmetic, GUI & Design, loops, decisions, behaviors, interactions, other groups of code, etc.)
- Coding smaller solutions to a subproblem, then combining solutions for the larger problem demonstrates increasing sophistications of computational thinking

Reminder about Creating RELEASES for Due Dates
- Releases are created from your most recent "stable version" or due date using the MAIN Branch
- Reminder: Create a TAG like BETA (press the ADD Button)
- If you have access to a non-school computer, you can also EXPORT your program so it runs on any computer like it is yours. This helps with grading
  - File / Export: exports Processing and Java files (called jar files) so the Processing and Java Installations and configuration are not required, automatically runs as if on your computer (after downloaded)
  - If you EXPORT,  Reminder: Drag and Drop your files into BINARY
- Must share GitHub URL for your RELEASE to find your final version
- Alternatively, create a new Repository or Folder and Upload the exported file there.
