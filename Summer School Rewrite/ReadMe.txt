Introduction to Processing-IDE and Variables
- Drawing a Rectangle (Continuation from Websites, DIVs): floats and doubles with size
- Note: ratios only to know about space (continuing from Websites, pixel counting is not useful when displays change)
- Quick Assignment: drawing other shapes
- Sequential Coding Assignment: developing visual data of 2D Shapes (review of Processing.org / Reference)
- Full Assignment: drawing rect() with (note: all single lines of code)
  1. Text using Strings
  2. Images using PImage Variables
  3. Imbedded 2D Shapes within rect()
- Note: will develop sequential algorithms for text, images (aspect ratio), and imbedded shapes

Introduction to Single-line-IFs and other Decisions: Display Geometry
- size() vs. fullScreen()
- Display Dimensions
- Display Orientation
- [Algorithm] Will size work on the current display?
- [Algorithm] Is display the same orientation as what developer coded for?
- [Advanced] Can code save user from not knowing about display orientations (i.e. "Bruh, turn your phun")
- [Advanced]: media queries (similar to Websites)

Measles Assignment (or Celebration Cards, etc.)
- Top Grades for Advanced Measles or Celebration Cards

Tools to develop
- sequential code for visual data
- how to count
- primitive data
- Booleans to communicate between procedures
- subprograms (VOIDs) for specific uses
- [OPTIONAL] Text Auto-calculator
