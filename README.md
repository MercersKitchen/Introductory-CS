# Introductory-CS
Android App Development & Web Promotion in Synchronous or A-Synchronous Engagement

---

## Webpages

**Purpose**: laying out an information Webpage or Simple Website, hosted remotely on GitHub & using GitHub as version control and deployment
- Integration of GitHub, Atom, and Local Browser-rendering (i.e. Chrome) to prototype with HTML and inline CSS
- See GitHub instruction about web hosting
- See Vertical Teaming of Introductory, Intermediate, and Advanced Computer Science

## App Development

**Purpose**: Coding to unknown android device ("One code to control them all")
- Introduction to device permissions & data ownership
- See Vertical Teaming of Introductory, Intermediate, and Advanced Computer Science
  - <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Overview#computer-apps">Click Here</a>
- Rubrics are actually a gamification of High School CS
- Learning Project Completion through manual and automated version control & prototyping-then-integration

## Getting Ready for Introductory CS

Getting Email and Google Classroom Ready
- EMail
  - Password Manager (Last Pass, KeePass), introduction to cyber security & review these two tools
    - See <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/8-character-password-dead,news-29429.html">This Article, last accessed 20201113</a> for information on 12 or 16 character passwords
    - Since Passwords need to be longer, passPhrases no longer work well for people who use the Internet a lot
    - Mr. Mercer owns a paper and pencil book for his most sensitive passwords and only accesses these in specific physical locations
  - General EMail Security: pwned: see https://haveibeenpwned.com/ (last accessed 20201113)
    - Enable notifications (confirm through email), free service
    - Used by Badrap, <a href="https://badrap.io/">here, active on 20201113</a>, to register multiple address & other resources (like your network if you login from a home computer)
  - An article for creating **strong** passwords, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-make-sure-your-passwords-havent-been-stolen-1837305758">In Lifehacker, last accessed 20201113</a>
  - An interesting read, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/when-a-company-asks-you-to-reset-your-password-should-1837516590">What if a company asks you to reset your password, should you be worried?</a> (last accessed 20201113)
    - Answer: No! Passwords are meant to be changed
- Google Classroom: See Mr. Mercer for Classroom Codes (Students, if someone doesn't have a code, please email it to them)

### GitHub Quick Notes for Android Hosting

GitHub Webpage and Website Hosting
- Links TBA

<a href="">Hosing code, versions, final version and executables in GitHub</a>
- Exporting executables in processing are important in grading
- Jar Files, dependencies processing has added that might be different on my machine, will be included
- Exemplar executable program files one step from deploying to Android, <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Computer-App-Exemplars">here</a>

### Other details: why this Science Option is worth *NOT* completing a *DIPLOMA Exam*
- "The Grade" is only between the student and Mr. Mercer
- Learning, Evaluation, and Assessment

# How we learn

Coding the Hard Way: typing out every line, sometimes using copy and paste
- Caution: Processing-JAVA will break if copy and paste is used too much (copy into Notepad to delete hidden formatting characters or retype the entire doc)
- Mr. Mercer will demonstrate his method for typing code

Evaluation: bugs and talking about code provides Mr. Mercer anecdotal evidence of your learning

Assessment: multiple types
- submitting program apps so Mr. Mercer can experience the user experience and read some code
- submitting narrated videos (max 60 seconds) of code highlighting coding structures Mr. Mercer is asking for while explaining what they do (arithmetic, GUI & Design, loops, decisions, behaviors, interactions, other groups of code, etc.)

# To Include

Prototyping means dealing with the smallest amount of code, then building something more
  modularly

Note: prototyping means taking a large problem and breaking it into pieces, then writing code that will eventually be incorporated.
- "The sum is greater than the parts": integrated code breaks because of the sum, not because the code is broken
- We need to know the difference between parts and sum

Case Studies of behavior: APCS Flowcharting
- Using GitHub Markdown to make lists and checklists

# Additional Videos to Review

Algorithms
- Triggers
- Data to work on
- produce at least one result
- terminate after successful measure
- "Divide and conquor"
