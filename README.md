# Introductory-CS
Android App Development & Website Promotion in Synchronous or A-Synchronous Engagement

**NOTE**: only have a Chromebook?
- REPL.IT or https://replit.com/ is a good option that fully syncs to GitHub
- Good Video to link GitHub with Repl.it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14BzqAx55ao">Repl.it Github Integration, Accessed 20220223</a>

**CAUTION** Mr. Mercer has not tested this fully but it remains an option

### Other details: this *Science Option* does **not** include a *Diploma Exam*
- "The Grade" is only between the student and Mr. Mercer
- Learning, Evaluation, and Assessment

### Industry-level: Hosing code, versions, final version and executables in GitHub
- Exporting executables in processing are important in grading
- Jar Files, dependencies processing has added that might be different on my machine, will be included
- Exemplar executable program files one step from deploying to Android, <a href="https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Computer-App-Exemplars">here</a>

# How we learn

Coding the Hard Way: typing out every line, sometimes using copy and paste
- Caution: Processing-JAVA will break if copy and paste is used too much (copy into Notepad to delete hidden formatting characters or retype the entire doc)
- See https://github.com/QEHS-ProcessingJava/Common-Syntax-Error-and-Solution
- Mr. Mercer will demonstrate his method for typing code

Evaluation: bugs and talking about code provides Mr. Mercer anecdotal evidence of your learning

Assessment: multiple types
- submitting coded apps so Mr. Mercer can experience the user experience and read some code
- submitting narrated videos (max 60 seconds) of code highlighting coding structures Mr. Mercer is asking for while explaining what they do (arithmetic, GUI & Design, loops, decisions, behaviors, interactions, other groups of code, etc.)
- Coding smaller solutions to a subproblem, then combining solutions for the larger problem demonstrates increasing sophistications of computational thinking

Reminder about Creating RELEASES for Due Dates
- Releases are created from your most recent "stable version" or due date using the MAIN Branch
- Reminder: Create a TAG like BETA (press the ADD Button)
- If you have access to a non-school computer, you can also EXPORT your program so it runs on any computer like it is yours. This helps with grading
  - File / Export: exports Processing and Java files (called jar files) so the Processing and Java Installations and configuration are not required, automatically runs as if on your computer (after downloaded)
  - If you EXPORT,  Reminder: Drag and Drop your files into BINARY
- Must share GitHub URL for your RELEASE to find your final version
- Alternatively, create a new Repository or Folder and Upload the exported file there.
