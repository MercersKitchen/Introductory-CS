# Introductory-CS
Android App Development in Synchronous or A-Synchronous Engagement

**Purpose**: laying out an information Webpage or Simple Website, hosted remotely on GitHub & using GitHub as version control and deployment
- Integration of GitHub, Atom, and Local Rendering to prototype with HTML and inline CSS
- See GitHub instruction about web hosting

**Purpose**: Coding to unknown android device
- Introduction to device permissions & data ownership
- See Vertical Teaming of Introductory, Intermediate, and Advanced Computer Science

- Rubrics are actually a gamification of High School CS
- Learning Project Completion through manual and automated version control & prototyping-then-integration

# Other details: why a Science Option is worth *NOT* completing a *DIPLOMA Exam*
- "The Grade" is only between the student and Mr. Mercer
- Learning, Evaluation, and Assessment

### How we learn

Coding the Hard Way: typing out every line, sometimes using copy and paste
- Caution: Processing-JAVA will break if copy and paste is used too much (copy into Notepad to delete hidden formatting characters or retype the entire doc)
- Mr. Mercer will demonstrate his method for typing code

Evaluation: bugs and talking about code provides Mr. Mercer anecdotal evidence of your learning

Assessment: multiple types
- submitting program apps so Mr. Mercer can experience the user experience and read some code
- submitting narrated videos (max 60 seconds) of code highlighting coding structures Mr. Mercer is asking for while explaining what they do (arithmetic, GUI & Design, loops, decisions, behaviors, interactions, other groups of code, etc.)

# To Include

Prototyping means dealing with the smallest amount of code, then building something more
  modularly

Note: prototyping means taking a large problem and breaking it into pieces, then writing code that will eventually be incorporated.
- "The sum is greater than the parts": integrated code breaks because of the sum, not because the code is broken
- We need to know the difference between parts and sum

Case Studies of behavior: APCS Flowcharting
- Using GitHub Markdown to make lists and checklists
